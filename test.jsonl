Create one or more of the following temporary directories in the same file system:  * JazzSM_Image_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of the Jazz for Service Management platform-specific image.\n      * Image_Imgs_Home directory; which refers to the directory that will contain the extracted contents of platform-specific images for middleware. Tip: You only create this directory if you intend to install IBM DB2®; IBM WebSphere® Application Server.\n        \n        \n     \n     \n 4.   Navigate to the IBM Passport Advantage web site [http://www.ibm.com/software/howtobuy/passportadvantage/pao_customers.htm]. \n     Note: You require an IBM Customer ID to sign in and continue.\n 5.  Select the Find by part number search option under Download finder options.\n 6.  Search for each downloadable image by part number; as outlined in the relevant Operating_System tab in this download document.\n 7.  Select and download only the images for your platform that you need.\n 8.  Extract the downloaded images into directories that you created in step 3. \n     \n     Important: If you have downloaded the middleware and you want to perform a full installation; ensure that your Install_Imgs_Home directory is set up as follows:\n     |-ESE (Windows) [extracted DB2 installation image on Windows] \n     |-ese (UNIX) [extracted DB2 installation image on AIX; Linux; or Linux for System z] \n     |-WASRepository [extracted WebSphere Application Server installation image]\n     |-TCRCognos [extracted Tivoli Common Reporting Cognos® installation image] This directory structure is not required for a custom installation; for example; installing a subset of integration services by using the launchpad custom workflow or IBM Installation Manager GUI.\n     \n     \n 9.  To perform a full installation; download the Quick Start image with a part number of CNC1MML. It contains quick start guides for these installation scenarios.  * CNC1MML_JazzSM_lang_code.pdf - Quick start guide for the full installation scenario; to install all Jazz for Service Management integration services; IBM DB2®; and IBM WebSphere® Application Server on a single server for evaluation and development purposes. \n     \n     \n 10. If you want to perform a custom installation; for example; install only a subset of Jazz for Service Management integration services or use existing supported installations of WebSphere Application Server or DB2; see Custom installation scenario [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0/com.ibm.psc.doc/install/psc_c_install_advanced_opt.html] in the Jazz for Service Management documentation.\n\n\n\nTAB NAVIGATION\n * AIX®\n * Linux\n * Linux on System z®\n * Windows\n\n\n\nSee Jazz for Service Management Detailed System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27038732] for the AIX operating systems on which Jazz for Service Management is supported.\n\nDownloadable images with part numbers\n\nYou can download electronic images for Jazz for Service Management and its database and application server middleware.

{"id": "VAL_Q008", "document": "IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States  TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? \n\nANSWER\nHSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance.

Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/]. \n\n\n\n\nLocating the Core Dump \n\nFor WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>/profiles/<PROFILE_NAME>/ \n\nThe file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. \n\n\n\n\nProcessing the Dump \n\nExecute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use ./jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. \n\nReplace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. \n\n \n\nIf you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. \n\n \n\nDetermining the Java Directory \n\nBecause different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. \n\n \n\nNOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n32-bit JVM and\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled\nAIX/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\n\n\n\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled\nDoes not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1\nAIX/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>/<JAVA_DIR>/jre/bin/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMax Heap Size \n\nTo adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFiles Generated \n\nThe output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. \n\nCore files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file \n\n \n\nIf you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nError Messages \n\nEyeCatcher Error\nUnable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher\nError. Internal failure detected during jextract \n\nThis error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including \n\n* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server\n* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.\n* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). \n\n \n\nOut of Memory Error \n\nSometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFAQ \n\nHow do I determine if compressed references is enabled? \n\nCompressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. \n\nChecking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs \n\nIf you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) \n\n \n\nWhat happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? \n\nIf you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n MustGather: Crash on AIX [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21055387]\nMustGather: Crash on Linux [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21104706]\nMustGather: Crash on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21053924]\nGenerating Userdumps on Windows [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21138203]\nCrash on AIX produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21052642]\nCrash on Linux produces no core or a truncated core [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115658]", "question": "How to proceed when jextract utility is throwing an OutOfMemory error ? \n\nI was getting a crash and was told to provide a \"jextracted core dump\".

{"id": "VAL_Q013", "document": "IBM When and how to apply a modification or fix pack - United States fix pack update bug correction APAR TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n When and how should I apply a modification or fix pack to my JRules or Operational Decision Management (WODM/ODM) installation?\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe Operational Decision Manager version numbers use the standard IBM formatV.R.M.Fwhich stands for Version.Release.Modification.Fixpack. See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details. \n\n\nModification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F. \n\n\nModification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.\n\n\nSee the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:\n\n\n * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.\n   \n * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.\n   \n * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version. \n   \n * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.\n   \n * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.\n\n\n\nReferring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725]. \n\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements. \nANSWER\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits: \n\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed. \n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example). \n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\n\n\n\nWHEN TO UPDATE\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available. \n\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs. \n\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE UPDATING\n\n\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating: \n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server. \n\n\n\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack. \n\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile. \n\n\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps. \n\n\n\n\nUPDATING\n\n\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update. \n\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\lib. \n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\<Module>\\applicationservers\\<App Server> folders.\n\n\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries. \n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\n\n\n\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof. \n\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html]. \n\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same. \n\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\n\n\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear \n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server. \n\n\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\n\n\nUpdate the following application in your application server: \n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\n\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear. \n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector \n     * wbehttpconnector \n     * wbejdbcconnector \n     * wbejmsconnector \n     * wbesoapconnector\n    \n    \n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear. \n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\n\n\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules). \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information. \n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page).

Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\n\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\n\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\n\n\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\n   \n   \n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\n\n\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information. \n\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data. \n\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process: \n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\n    \n    \n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\n    \n    \n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\n    \n\n\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle. \n\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support details: \nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html] \n\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk. \n\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.
